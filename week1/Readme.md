## Readme for Week1 Assignment

This is a readme file for the week-1 programming assignment from the exploratory analysis course (a part of the data science specialization). 

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. In particular, the data used is the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

The Dataset: Electric power consumption
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

## 
Based on this dataset and for the given time period ( a 2-day period in February, 2007), 4 graphs were created as required.

As a part of the assignment, I have created an assignment_1_utilities file (placed in https://github.com/preethical/Exploratory-Analysis_Main) which has code that is repeatedly used in plotting all the other graphs. It has been sourced into each of these files. This was done to decrease the redundant code in the different files.

All the code works on the assumption that the dataset provided was downloaded and extracted into your working directory.
